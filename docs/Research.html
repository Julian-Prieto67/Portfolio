              INTRODUCTION
            </h2>
            <p>
              As part of the Collective Embodied Intelligence Lab I worked on a control algorithm for robotic swarms. I
              facilitated all
              hardware equipment, performed repairs on the chassis of robots, and modified the experiment setup.
              The robots were programmed in Microchip studio using C. The experiments I carried out proved that robots
              moving randomly in
              a swarm could be controlled by changing their shape and sensing their neighbors. The name of the paper is
              "The Robo-Physics of Distributed Shape Change Algorithms in
              Stochastic Collectives" and it has since been submitted to the 2025 IEEE International Conference on
              Robotics and Automation (ICRA).
            </p>
            <h3 style="text-align: center;">ABSTRACT</h3>
            <p>
              Years of observing biological life have taught researchers the importance of shape on collectives like
              proteins and enzymes.
              This project aims to translate these strategies toward robotics. By manipulating shape through algorithms
              that react to an individualâ€™s
              surroundings, a collective of robots can exhibit predictable and controllable behaviors that contribute to
              a larger goal. By using swarms that
              are cheap, have simple rules, and a statistically significant outcome, we can create a robust and
              effective system that can be implemented in exploration
              missions or medicinal nano-technology.
            </p>
            <h3> THE THEORY</h3>
            <div class="col-lg-12" style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
              <img src="images\sim.gif" alt="simulation" style="width: 30%; margin-bottom: 10px;">
            </div>

            <div class="col-lg-12">
              <p> The simulation shown is a simplistic model of a swarm of shape changing robots moving randomly. Given
                enough collisions,
                they shape change to a rectangle and after enough time has passed they move from the more crowded area
                to the more spacious room no the right without any directional input.
                This is statistically significant and controllable behavior. Once this was proved in simulation, the
                goal was to perform this narrow hallway test in real life. I set up a rectangular arena that could be customized with plastic dividers to 
                emulate the narrow hallway simulation above. The robots were to be placed in this arena and their interactions and behavior were recorded and 
                analyzed using mounted april-tags.   
              </p>

                <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-sm-6">
                  <p> On the left are the robot agents used for the hardware experiment. They utilize a toy ball
                    designed for pets that simulate random brownian motion
                    by driving an internal motor with an off-center counterweight. On top of this wild body is a
                    lightweight hub 3D printed from PETG. The shape-changes
                    are carried out by microservos actuating arms that pull on a paper skirt to change into three
                    shapes: an oblong shape, a star shape, and a convex shape.
                    Each Hub weighed 15g including the PCB, microservos, and sensors. The chassis was incredibly light and fragile which made assembly a delicate process.
                    The skirts were cut from a cardstock paper and glued to the hub. Despite the ligthweight design, the robots had a difficult time moving the weight
                    of the hub and as a result I had to design a solution to make the robots move more efficiently.

            <h4>My Experiment</h4>
            <div class="container">
              <div class="row">
                <div class="col-lg-8 col-md-8 col-sm-8">
                  <p> 
                    In order to influence more motion in the agents, we decided to modify the counterweight in each of the wild bodies. I performed several trials 
                    with varying weights and was able to show that the robots moved more efficiently with a heavier counterweight. This motion was quantified by
                    the mean squared displacement graph shown below. The raw trajectories of the robots these curves are derived from are shown below.
                  </p>
                  <p> 
                    The weight was added in a quick experiment by using increasing amounts of small neodymium magnets. The magnets were placed on the counterweight, which 
                    is a small piece of mild steel, and the wild body was tested in the arena. The results showed that a bigger counterweight could move more mass with a drop
                    off in motion once the internal motor could no longer fit the magnets. This was a simple solution to a complex problem and it was a great example of testing out 
                    any idea as a potential solution. Once the mass of the counterweight was decided, a more denser alloy of steel was used to make a new counterweight that replaced
                    the old ones.

            <h3> What I Learned</h3>
            <p> 
              This project was my first experience in research and I'm greatful I had the opportunity to work on it. Getting to work with 
              Dr. Alexandra Quay Nilles was an eye-opening experience and I learned a lot about the research process. I got my start in computer vision from 
              this project and I was able to practice my CAD work to solve some unique problems including a custom mount for the camera we used. This project was one of many
              that had me think of practical solutions to hiccups that come up during research. I'm proud of the work I did and I'm excited to see our get paper published.
